# chance-cube

Randomly shows a UN member state, along with its capital and other relevant data.
I take no responsibility for how accurate this is. 

## Data Set
* ~~Name (en)~~ 	
* ~~Native Name~~ 
* ~~Capital~~ 
* ~~Languages~~ 
* ~~Population~~ 
* Map
* Flag


## Todo
* ~~Add nation data.~~ Filter data for only UN member states. 
* ~~Format population numbers~~
* ~~Fade data sets in and out over each other.~~
* Stylin'; Better UX experience.
* ~~Set timer to reload in development~~
* Live data i.e current temperature, local time.


## Long Term
* ~~Make a browser extension which opens this code on opening a new tab.~~
* Allow user to select if the data changes over time period.
* Allow settings to let user overlay the top of the current window with data.
